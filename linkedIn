🌟  Day 13 - Transforming Hero Section with click based Animations 🚀

Excited to share an animated section transition where a dynamic div's moves fluidly, scales, and seamlessly reveals content. It’s perfect for creating engaging experiences for portfolios or agency websites. Inspired by an award-winning website, this project combines dynamic GSAP animations, a innovative method of revealing content with a fluid motion on click and a sleek, responsive design.

💼 I’m actively seeking new job opportunities in creative web development and design, including international roles.
